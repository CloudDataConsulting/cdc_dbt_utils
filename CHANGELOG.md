## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - Unreleased
### Added
- New dimensional models at different time grains (all derived from dim_date for consistency):
  - **dim_week**: Week-level dimension derived from dim_date with ISO week standards and retail calendar
  - **dim_month**: Month-level dimension derived from dim_date with fiscal and retail attributes
  - **dim_quarter**: Quarter-level dimension derived from dim_date including fiscal year support
- dim_date_retail model with retail calendar support and comprehensive date features:
  - All standard calendar features from dim_date
  - Retail/trade calendar with 4-4-5, 4-5-4, and 5-4-4 patterns
  - Complete set of date, week, month, quarter, and year attributes
  - ISO week standards and date formatting options
- dim_date_retail.yml with model documentation and tests
- CHANGELOG.md for tracking version history
- CLAUDE.md for repository guidance

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Standardized all column naming conventions with class words at the end:
  - All `_number` columns renamed to `_num` (e.g., `quarter_number` → `quarter_num`)
  - All `_name` columns renamed to `_nm` (e.g., `quarter_name` → `quarter_nm`)
  - Date identifiers use `_key` suffix for YYYYMMDD format (e.g., `week_begin_key`)
  - ISO columns prefixed with `iso_` (e.g., `iso_day_of_week_num`, `iso_year_num`)
  - "Overall" metrics follow pattern `{measure}_overall_{class}` (e.g., `day_overall_num`)
  - Proper class word suffixes: `_dt` for dates, `_key` for date keys, `_flg` for flags, `_txt` for text

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: All verbose column names from dim_date (e.g., `quarter_number`, `quarter_name`)
- Users must update to use new abbreviated naming convention
