- Basic project structure and documentation

## Testing Instructions for 0.2.0-beta.1

### What to Test

1. **Logging Integration**
   - Pre/post hooks automatically log model executions
   - Error logging captures failures appropriately
   - Row counts are captured when enabled
   - Process IDs link correctly between start/stop

2. **Configuration**
   - Test with `cdc_logging.enabled: false` to ensure it doesn't break models
   - Verify schema configuration works with your logging tables location
   - Test environment-specific settings (dev vs prod)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Models should continue to work even if logging procedures don't exist
   - Logging failures shouldn't break model execution
   - Error messages are properly captured in error_log table

4. **Performance**
   - Minimal overhead from logging calls
   - Row counting doesn't significantly slow large models

### How to Test

1. Add to your packages.yml:
   ```yaml
   packages:
     - git: "https://github.com/CloudDataConsulting/cdc_dbt_utils.git"
       revision: 0.2.0-beta.1
   ```

2. Configure in dbt_project.yml:
   ```yaml
   vars:
     cdc_logging:
       enabled: true
       schema: 'dw_util'  # Your logging schema
   
   models:
     +pre-hook: "{{ cdc_dbt_utils.process_start() }}"
     +post-hook: "{{ cdc_dbt_utils.process_stop() }}"
   ```

3. Run your models and check:
   - `dw_util.process_report_v` for execution tracking
   - `dw_util.error_log` for any errors
   - Model output remains unchanged

### Known Limitations

- Requires CDC Snowflake logging framework to be installed
- Process IDs may not persist correctly between pre/post hooks in all scenarios
- Row counting requires additional SELECT COUNT(*) query
