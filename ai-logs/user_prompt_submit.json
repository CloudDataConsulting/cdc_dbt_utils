What is the best practice so that we can update this to follow the same standards as `dim_date_retail`, but support people who might be using that version in production? I have two thoughts:\n1. We could rename this to dim_date_legacy, or\n2. We could have a dim_date_new.\nNeither one of those seems optimum to me because the model name is going to flow through into the table names when they use these features. So is there a best practice with dbt packages? What can you suggest?"
