    description: |
      Trade date dimension table with all three common patterns (445, 454, 544).
      This model provides trade_week_of_month calculations for all patterns in a single table,
      making it easy to support different retail calendar requirements without multiple models.
      
      Column naming follows CDC standards:
      - _dt for dates/timestamps
      - _num for numbers
      - _flg for boolean flags
      - _nm for names
      - _ts for timestamps
      
      Key Features:
      - Single table with all three patterns
      - Columns suffixed with pattern type (_445_num, _454_num, _544_num)
      - No configuration or lookups needed - all patterns always available
      - Designed for cdc_dbt_utils package
      
      Pattern Details:
      - 445: Each quarter has 4-4-5 week months (13 weeks per quarter)
      - 454: Each quarter has 4-5-4 week months (13 weeks per quarter)  
      - 544: Each quarter has 5-4-4 week months (13 weeks per quarter)
