    description: |
      Trade calendar quarter dimension table containing one row per trade quarter, derived from dim_trade_month for consistency.
      Provides quarter-level aggregations and attributes for retail/trade calendar analysis at quarterly granularity.

      Since all trade calendar patterns have identical quarterly structure (13 weeks per quarter),
      this model has a single record per trade quarter.

      Column naming follows CDC standards:
      - _dt for dates/timestamps
      - _num for numbers
      - _flg for boolean flags
      - _nm for names
      - _key for keys in YYYYMMDD or YYYYQQ format
      - _txt for text strings
      - _abbr for abbreviations

      Key Features:
      - Single record per trade quarter (patterns are identical at quarter level)
      - Derived from dim_trade_month to ensure consistency
      - Includes special records (-1: Unknown, -2: Invalid, -3: Not Applicable)
      - Navigation keys for time series analysis
      - All patterns have 13 weeks per quarter (14 weeks in Q4 for 53-week years)

      Pattern Details:
      - 445: Each quarter has 4-4-5 week months (13 weeks per quarter)
      - 454: Each quarter has 4-5-4 week months (13 weeks per quarter)
      - 544: Each quarter has 5-4-4 week months (13 weeks per quarter)
