  - name: dim_trade_quarter
    description: |
      Trade calendar quarter dimension table containing one row per trade quarter per pattern, derived from dim_trade_date for consistency.
      Provides quarter-level aggregations and attributes for retail/trade calendar analysis at quarterly granularity.
      
      Since trade calendar patterns have the same quarterly structure (13 weeks per quarter), all patterns create similar quarter boundaries.
      This model includes all three patterns (445, 454, 544) with separate records for each pattern combination.
      
      Column naming follows CDC standards:
      - _dt for dates/timestamps
      - _num for numbers
      - _flg for boolean flags
      - _nm for names
      - _key for date keys in YYYYMMDD format
      - _txt for text strings
      
      Key Features:
      - Separate records for each pattern (445, 454, 544)
      - Pattern-specific quarter boundaries and metrics
      - Derived from dim_trade_date to ensure consistency
      - Trade quarters follow retail calendar conventions with Sunday start weeks
      - All patterns have 13 weeks per quarter (14 weeks in Q4 for 53-week years)
      
      Pattern Details:
      - 445: Each quarter has 4-4-5 week months (13 weeks per quarter)
      - 454: Each quarter has 4-5-4 week months (13 weeks per quarter)  
      - 544: Each quarter has 5-4-4 week months (13 weeks per quarter)
      
      Primary Key Logic:
      - trade_quarter_pattern_key: Unique across all patterns (YYYYQ###)
      - trade_quarter_key: Pattern-specific key (YYYYQ format)
